The CNN Moneyâ€™s Market Movers website (https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ )
tracks the most active stocks on a real time basis. Specifically, the most active, the top gainers and
top losers are listed at any instance in time. You will first write Python scripts that collect the list of
most actives, gainers and losers from the above website. Next, your programs should take the ticker
symbols and names of these companies (and categories) and build a csv file (called stocks.csv) with
data about each stock from the website:
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD?p=AMD&.tsrc=fin-srch-v1 which gives the quote for
ticker symbol AMD as an example. The data to be collected from the Yahoo Finance site should
include:
OPEN price
PREV CLOSE price
VOLUME
MARKET CAP
Your code should also list the names of the companies in the order and categories listed in the
website: https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ and ask the user to choose a company to get the
data on. Once the user chooses the company of interest, your program should display its
corresponding data (Open, Prev Close, Volume and Market Cap).
